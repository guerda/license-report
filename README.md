LicenseReport
=============
The LicenseReport is an [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) plugin to create a
small report about all used licenses in a specific project.

As there was no solution for this problem, the project idea started on the
following question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com):
[How can I compile a report showing all used licenses with Ant?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024819/how-can-i-compile-a-report-showing-all-used-licenses-with-ant)
